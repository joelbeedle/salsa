## Contributing to SALSA

The following headings answer the questions "How do I contribute, in regards to __ if I (have / want to) __"

### **Bugs...**

#### **Found a bug**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/joelbeedle/salsa/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/joelbeedle/salsa/issues/new), and use the **Bug Report** template
  
#### **Fixed a bug**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch, using the **Bug Fix** template.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Features...**
#### **Adding a new feature or changing an existing one**

* Suggest your change in the [ideas discussion board](https://github.com/joelbeedle/salsa/discussions/categories/ideas), and code the change.

* Ideally, don't open an issue until you've had some positive discussion regarding the change. To prevent clogging up issues, in SALSA they are intended to be for bug fixes, reports, and changes.

#### **Adding a new Algorithm to the main testbed**

* Suggest the algorithm in the [ideas discussion board](https://github.com/joelbeedle/salsa/discussions/categories/ideas), and write the algorithm. An ideal shared algorithm should ideally be one that others could use or extend, such as Reynold's Boids.

* Then, open an issue using the **Add Algorithm** template

* Once the algorithm works, and is tested, create a pull request for the issue.

### **Questions...**

#### Ask a Question about anything
* Ask any question about how to use **SALSA** either in the [Q&A discussion board](https://github.com/joelbeedle/salsa/discussions/categories/q-a) or by messaging the contributors.

Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to SALSA! We hope to see your contributions in the future!
